# ecommerce

Welcome to simple ecommerce app built using Flutter! app consists of three main screens: the home page, product list, and cart list.

On the product list screen, users can browse through various products available for purchase. Each product item includes an "Add to Cart" button, allowing users to easily add products to their shopping cart.

The cart list screen displays the items that the user has added to their cart. Users can view the products they've selected for purchase, along with details.
The cart count dynamically updates as products are added or removed, providing users with real-time feedback on the number of items in their cart.

In the cart list, users have the option to remove items from their cart by tapping on the "Remove" button associated with each product.

With our intuitive interface and seamless shopping experience, our Flutter ecommerce app makes it easy for users to browse, shop, and manage their cart efficiently.
